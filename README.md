This game is designed to showcase the capabilities of MemView.

While MemView wasn't originally intended for running games.

I'll attempt to use every new feature of MemView in this game as a code example.

To simplify understanding MemView, all calls to it are made exclusively in Game.ts.

### Play the Game

#### Prerequisites

You need to have NodeJS runtime on your computer https://nodejs.org/

Download the .zip file by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".

Once downloaded, extract it to a folder, navigate to that folder, and run:

`npm i`

Then start the game with:

`npm run dev`

It will automatically open a new tab in your browser to play the game.

### Gameplay

You control a snake and must eat apples.

Be careful! If you don't eat an apple in time, it will turn into a sapling. If you don't destroy the sapling quickly, it will grow into a tree.

After some time, trees will die, allowing you to smash them and reclaim the land.
